My deployment method will be a web app built with Streamlit. The app will have a simple UI that asks the user for an input URL for a tweet. Then, the app will apply the model in the background and return the probability that a given tweet contains hate speech, visualized using a bar chart. For next steps, I need to build the UI, get the model running in the background, connect the Twitter API, test, debug, and then package up the app for Github.
