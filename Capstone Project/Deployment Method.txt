My deployment method will be an API web-app built with Flask. The app will have a simple UI that asks the user for an input URL for a tweet. Then, the API will apply the model in the background and return the probability that a given tweet contains hate speech, visualized using a bar chart in the UI. For next steps, I need to build the UI with HTML, get the model running in the background, account for edge/strain cases that the API may have to handle, test, debug, and then package up everything in GitHub.
